Now, you're there in my happiest moments and you've been there when I'm at my worst. Our external worlds may be so different, but we've really been through ALL the moods, eras, seasons, phases, everything together. 
                <br> <br>And I think of you so much, everyday. When I see sunflowers. Or fanfiction with 'lemons' in the title. When I'm making Christmas plans. Or when I type 'so much pyaaaaar' because that's the absolute cutest thing you say. <br>I think of you when I look at the sunset and I'll think of you everytime I look at the moon.</p>

            <p class="serif accent centre"> Some of the most precious moments have been over a cup of coffee, hot chocolate or Smirnoff. At Juhu beach, after a full day of lectures, while the sun sets. At 11 pm, on a week night with fresh cinnamon rolls as an excuse. A quick dinner at August cafe, while attending a meeting on mute. While my code runs, or while I'm out for a run.</p>

            <p class="serif accent centre"><br>'All Things Nice' is exactly what you make me feel. That pinterest board is such a joy, I tell you. I love seeing what you've saved. Manifesting all of it. It will all fall in place when the time is right, love. Vienna waits for you.</p>

            <p style="font-size: smaller;">You wrote something for me in 10th which I think of a lot recently. You said "I'm not going to ask you 'be who you are always'. I want you to change and evolve into someone you want to be" and I love that so much. I'm glad to have my support system. I hope you feel that you can count on us always as well.</p>
            <p style="font-size: smaller;">You do realise that we're all kinda permanent to each other now, right? Like 'Maasi status to future kids' type permanent. Whoa. There's all these invisible strings, and they give me the sense that 'I'm Home; feeling when I'm with you. We love you the most. Happy Birthday, my BlueJ &#9829</p>
